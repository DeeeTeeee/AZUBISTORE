# Azubi Store
## Store Sales Review
### By: David Anifowowshe

In this project, Azubi Store has products that customers love. Below are the products, prices and the number of customers that patronize each product last week.

They want me to do some analysis on data with these criteria's:

    -calculate the total price average for all products

    -create a new price list that reduces the old prices by GHC5

    -calculate the total revenue generated from the products

    -calculate the average daily revenue generated from the products

    -based on the new prices, which products are less than GHC30
